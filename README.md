# Selvedge

Selvedge is a Rust repository scaffold with a clean local development flow, pre-commit hooks, and GitHub Actions CI.

## What is included

- Cargo binary crate with a small library surface for testing
- `Justfile` shortcuts for bootstrap, formatting, lint, test, and hook execution
- A dedicated `cargo xtask` command for AGENTS.md project-index maintenance
- Root `AGENTS.md` guidance for coding agents, including a repository file index
- `rust-toolchain.toml` to keep the repository on the stable toolchain
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` for formatting, lint, project-index, and test checks
- GitHub Actions CI for `fmt`, `clippy`, and `test`
- Basic repository hygiene files such as `.gitignore` and `.editorconfig`

## Quickstart

```bash
just run
just test
```

## Development setup

```bash
./scripts/bootstrap.sh
```

Run this once in a clean Ubuntu environment. It installs the Rust toolchain, `just`, `pre-commit`, and the repository hooks. When run as a non-root user, it will prompt for `sudo` during package installation.

## Common commands

```bash
just fmt
just check
just hooks
just agents-index
```

Use `just agents-index` after adding, removing, or renaming tracked files so the project index in `AGENTS.md` stays current. Use `just agents-index-check` to verify that the index is up to date without rewriting the file. The index is built from Git-tracked files, so ignored and untracked files stay out automatically. Both commands warn when an indexed directory has an unusually large number of direct filesystem entries.

The underlying repository commands are `cargo xtask agents-index update` and `cargo xtask agents-index check`.
